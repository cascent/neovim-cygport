CATEGORY="Libs"
SUMMARY="MessagePack implementation for C and C++"
DESCRIPTION="MessagePack is an efficient binary serialization format, which lets you exchange data among multiple languages like JSON, except that it's faster and smaller. Small integers are encoded into a single byte while typical short strings require only one extra byte in addition to the strings themselves."
